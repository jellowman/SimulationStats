# SimulationStats
A Java suite of post-analysis tools for molecular modeling simulations

The current state of the software includes a "core" framework that handles basic information  
of atoms and simulation boxes. Currently, the only file format supported is Tinker formatted .arc and .xyz files.  
It has one calculation implemented thus far, which is a RDF calculator.
